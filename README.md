# Altitude_Vitesse_gpx
Made to explore relationship between elevation and running speed using gpx files from my races.

# GPX Data Analysis for Running

This project analyzes GPX files of running outputs to correlate altitude, gradient, and speed. I started with very basic and not very useful analysis just to learn how to handle gpx files and finished with more insightful data relationship. I documented my thought process during the creation of this project.

# Features

- GPX parsing with gpxpy
- Calculation of gradient percentage and average speed
- Smoothed visualizations with Matplotlib
